            My name is Alejandra Fuentes, but I like to go by Alex, I was born
            in Maracaibo. I am 22 years old. I moved to the United States When I
            was 16. It was of course a very big change in my life. My whole life
            changed, I was way out of my comfort zone, specially the fact that I
            needed to learn a new language. But it was also exited.
            <br />
            <br />
            Anyways, I am happy now, I like how everything turned out be after
            all. I consider myself am a friendly person. I like to workout and
            take out my dogs and practice coding. This is another new experience
            for me, but that's what life is about, having new experiences is
            part of life, and also part of becoming who we are now and what we
            want to be.
